## Ingredients
- ~40g Parmasen cheese.
- ~30g Pecorino cheese.
- ~1/3rd bunch curly Parsley, finely chopped.
- A rasher or two of free range bacon.
- 1 large, free range egg.
- 1 large shallot, finely diced.
- Black pepper
- 125g egg noodle fettuccine
- White wine or saison beer.

## Method
### Step 1
Crack egg into a bowl. Grate all cheese into the egg. Mix well together. Grind pepper to taste into the mix.

### Step 2
Put a pot of water (for fettuccine) on heat and bring to boil.

### Step 3
Chop large bits of fat from the bacon. Chop bacon into bite size pieces.
Melt fat in a frypan, remove non-melty bits and add diced shallot to the pan.
Cook until it starts to soften. Add bacon.

### Step 4
Add pasta to water. Once it is boiling again, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water to the egg and cheese mix. Stir in well making a sauce.

### Step 5
When pasta is ready, quickly drain it and add it to the sauce.
The pasta heat will cook the egg and melt the cheese.

### Step 6
Add a sploosh of wine or saison to the bacon and shallots. Stir until liquid lifts the caramelised shallots.
Add all this to the pasta. Add the parsley. Mix together.
